## Assembly of multi-module programs. Calculation of the roots of equations and definite integrals

### Setting the task
With a given accuracy, calculate the area of a flat shape bounded by three curves.

1. **Equations of curves:**
1. $$f_1(x) = 0.35x^2 - 0.95x + 2.7$$
2. $$f_2(x) = 3x + 1$$
   3. $$f_3(x) = \frac{1}{x + 2}$$

3. **Method of approximate solution of equations:** The combined method.
4. **Quadrature formulas:** The Simpson method.
